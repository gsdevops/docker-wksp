## Image Building

* use suitable base image, preferably created by the vendor and a small image
* put the slowest changing parts at the top of the Dockerfile (the first that invalidates the cache will invalidate for all layers to come)
* multi-stage image building

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.16 AS builder
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/
RUN go get -d -v golang.org/x/net/html  
COPY app.go    ./
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o app .

FROM alpine:latest  
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/app ./
CMD ["./app"]  
```
